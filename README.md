# Ultrasound Fork

Please check out and purchase the official source through the link below:

[Get Ultrasound on Dynastic Repo](https://get.dyn.dev/ultrasound)

## Warnings

Do not use this source code to build or distrbute Ultrasound packages. It is very far behind the official Ultrasound repo. I merely used this as a learning guide for compiling packages and examining source code on Theos. 

## License

The original Ultrasound project is licensed under the [MIT license](/LICENSE). Please make sure you comply with its terms while using it in any way.

## Support the original creator

Ayden Panhuyzen makes excellent, high-quality tweaks on the Dynastic repo. I highly encourage you to go and check out some of his other work there. Thanks to him for providing the source code to learn from and test out!
